# Recipe Book

Let’s continue practicing our Git collaboration skills.

In this project, you’ll be playing the role of two collaborators working on a recipe book.


## Recipe Book


1.  Go into the veggie-favorites remote by using the cd command:

cd veggie-favorites

2.  Once inside veggie-favorites make a change to chili.txt and/or squash-lasagna.txt in the code editor.

Click Save, add your changes to the Git staging area, and then make a commit.

3.  Go into your clone with:

cd ../veggie-clone

Check out Codecademy’s Command Line course here to learn more about cd ..

4.  Fetch all new work from the remote.

5.  Merge origin/master into your local master branch .

6.  Create a new branch, then switch over to it to work on new-recipe.txt. The recipe can be whatever dish you’d like.

Click Save.

7.  Add your file changes to the staging area and make a commit.

8.  Fetch one more time just for good measure (there won’t be a change).

9.  Push your branch up to the remote.

10. Navigate back to the remote with:

cd ../veggie-favorites

Confirm the presence of your new Git branch there.
